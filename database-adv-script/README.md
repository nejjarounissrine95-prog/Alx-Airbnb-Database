- `joins_queries.sql` — contains three SQL queries using:
  - INNER JOIN (Bookings ↔ Users)
  - LEFT JOIN (Properties ↔ Reviews)
  - FULL OUTER JOIN (Users ↔ Bookings)


## Description
These queries show how to combine relational data efficiently:
- **INNER JOIN** returns only bookings linked to an existing user.
- **LEFT JOIN** lists all properties, even those without any review.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** merges users and bookings, showing all records from both sides.
